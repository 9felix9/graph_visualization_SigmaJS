# Seller Matching - Distribution

This directory contains the production build for seller matching visualization.

## Files

- **`index.html`** - Production HTML file (simple framework for showing visualization)
  - Contains embedded JSON data in `<script id="product-leads-json">` tag
  - Loads the bundled `bundle.js` file
  - Server injects graph data directly into a similar file with same structure as this one

- **`bundle.js`** - Compiled JavaScript bundle
  - Generated by Webpack from `src/seller_matching/app.js`
  - Contains all dependencies (Sigma.js, Graphology, ForceAtlas2)
  - Transpiled to ES5 for broad browser compatibility
  - Optimized and minified for production

## Generation

Create the bundle with:
```sh
npx webpack
```

Make sure to configure `webpack.config.cjs` for seller matching:
```javascript
entry: './src/seller_matching/app.js'
```

## Deployment

The server should:
1. Inject seller graph JSON into the `<script id="product-leads-json">` tag in `index.html`
2. Serve `index.html` (or a similar one) and `bundle.js` as static files
3. No Node.js runtime required on client side
